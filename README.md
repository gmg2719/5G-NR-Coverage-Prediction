# 5G-NR-Coverage-Prediction
Simulating a coverage map for 5G NR through few possibilities of path loss model. Main goal in the future would be creating a machine learning based path loss model.

## 1. Coverage Map - Free Space Path Loss Model ([Link](https://github.com/zulfadlizainal/5G-NR-Coverage-Prediction/tree/master/Coverage%20Map%20-%20Free%20Space%20PL%20Model))

This simulation is based on Free Space Path Loss model to estimate the SS-RSRP coverage in 5G NR. Few possibilities of configuration can be set to understand the impact of any RF parameter tuning to the coverage.
